    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me?
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c">
      <lines>Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b">
      <lines>I am chosen
Not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me
Not against me
I am who You say I am</lines>
    </verse>
