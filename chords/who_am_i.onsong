[G]Who am I that the highest King
Would [Em]welc[D]ome [G]me?

Oh His [Em]love [D]for [C]me
Oh His [Em]love [D]for [C]me


Chorus:
Who the [G]Son sets free
Oh is [D]free indeed
I'm a [Em]child [D]of [C]God
Yes I [G]am
In my [G]Father's house
There's a [D]place for me
I'm a [Em]child [D]of [C]God
Yes I [G]am

[G]Free at last, He has ransomed me
His [Em]grace [D]runs [G]deep
